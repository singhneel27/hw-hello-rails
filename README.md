Rails (version 8.0.1)
A database system such as PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite (SQLite is default for development)
Make sure you have these installed on your system.
* Configuration
Make sure your database is configured in config/database.yml for the environment youâ€™re working in (development, test, or production).
* Database creation
Create and set up the database by running the following commands:
bin/rails db:create
This will create the necessary databases for your application.
* Database initialization
If you need to populate the database with some initial data, you can run the seed file with:
bin/rails db:seed
This will load default records into your database, such as movies with title, rating, and release date.
